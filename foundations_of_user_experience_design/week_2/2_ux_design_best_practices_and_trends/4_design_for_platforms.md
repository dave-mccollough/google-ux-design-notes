Best practices when designing for mobile experience

- Call to action buttons should be placed front and center allowing the user the ability to easily complete a task
- Navigation menus should be short and simple

  - Menu items should only highlight the core functions of the product
  - Use gestures users are already familiar with - Tapping and swipping
  - Design for both directions a phone could be held
  - Reduce visual clutter

- Users behave differently depending on device

## Designing cross-platform experiences

- Desktops, laptops, and mobile phones are the most commonly used platforms for interacting with apps and websites.
