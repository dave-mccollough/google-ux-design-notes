# Five Phases of a Design Sprint

- The user comes first.. everything your team does during the sprint, should focus on the user!

### Phase 1 - Understand

- Get a clear picture of the design challenge
- This may involve learning from experts, conversations with individuals in other industries, etc.

### Phase 2 - Ideate

- Come up with ideas and build off of them to create solutions
- Sketch and present ideas
- Start planning for user testing
  - Recruit users for user testing

### Phase 3 - Decide

- Assess all possible solutions from previous phase and decide on the best solution
- Create step by step blueprint for Phase 4 - Prototype

### Phase 4 - Prototype

- Build first version of app or feature
- Doesn't have to be complete, just enough for users to test with
- Finish prepping for Phase 5 - Test
  - Finalize schedule
  - Finalize interview questions

### Phase 5 - Test

- Diverse group of people test and provide feedback on your product
- Observe how users react when testing your prototype and ask questions/gather feedback
